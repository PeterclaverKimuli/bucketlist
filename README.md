# BucketList

 This is an application that enables users to record and
 share things they want to achieve or experience before reaching
 a certain age and keeping track of their dreams and
 goals.
 
 ## Wire-Frames
 The [Wireframes](wireframes/Bucketlist.pdf) contain the
 structure and intended design of the Bucket List
 application.
 
 ## Design Implementation
 Using Html and CSS with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 the wireframe designs were implemented. These include:-
 
 * [Home Page](app/templates/index.html)
 * [Sign Up](ui/signup.html)
 * [Login](ui/login.html)
 * [Bucket List](ui/bucketlist.html)
 * [Bucket List Item](ui/bucketlistitem.html)
